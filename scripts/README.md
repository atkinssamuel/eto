# Script Index

## 00 Scripts
The 00 scripts are POC scripts for each of the implemented layer types.

### 00-01-sklearn-lr-model.py
Implements an sklearn LR model for comparison.

### 00-02-manual-lr.py
Implements a custom implementation of an LR model. This model utilizes a linear layer, a sigmoid activation function, the BCE loss function, and the gradient descent optimization function.

### 00-03-multi-layer-nn.py
Implements a fully-connected neural network. This model has three linear layers with sigmoid activation functions. It utilizes the BCE loss function and the gradient descent optimization function.

### 00-04-momentum.py
The purpose of this script is to test the functionality of the momentum optimization function. This model has a linear layer, a sigmoid activation function, the BCE loss function, and the classical momentum optimization function. 

### 00-05-NAG.py
