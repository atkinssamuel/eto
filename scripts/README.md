# Script Index

## 00 Scripts
The 00 scripts are "scrap" scripts. 

## 01 Scripts
The 01 scripts are POC scripts for each of the implemented layer and problem types.

### 01-01-sklearn-lr-model.py
Implements an sklearn LR model for comparison.

### 01-02-manual-lr.py
Implements a custom implementation of an LR model. This model utilizes a linear layer, a sigmoid activation function, the BCE loss function, and the gradient descent optimization function.

### 01-03-multi-layer-nn.py
Implements a fully-connected neural network. This model has three linear layers with sigmoid activation functions. It utilizes the BCE loss function and the gradient descent optimization function.

### 01-04-momentum.py
The purpose of this script is to test the functionality of the momentum optimization function. This model has a linear layer, a sigmoid activation function, the BCE loss function, and the classical momentum optimization function. 

### 01-05-NAG.py


## 02 Scripts
The 02 scripts are for testing various encryption integration functionalities

### 02-00-pybind-integration.py
This script was implemented to verify that a simple custom class can be imported and utilized in the library
